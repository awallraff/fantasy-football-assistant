# AI Rankings Service - Code Quality Review

The build is failing due to code quality issues in `lib/ai-rankings-service.ts`. This document provides feedback and recommendations for addressing these issues.

## Analysis

The `AIRankingsService` class is currently too complex and has several issues that affect code quality, maintainability, and testability:

*   **High Complexity:** The class is responsible for multiple concerns, including fetching data, building prompts, simulating AI responses, and parsing results. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle.
*   **Lack of Type Safety:** The code uses `any` and `unknown` types frequently, which undermines the benefits of TypeScript and can lead to runtime errors.
*   **Poor Readability:** Long methods with nested logic make the code difficult to read and understand.
*   **Difficult to Test:** The methods are not pure functions and have many dependencies on the class's state, making them hard to unit test.

## Recommendations

To address these issues and fix the build, I recommend the following actions:

1.  **Refactor the `AIRankingsService` Class:**
    *   **Separate Concerns:** Break down the `AIRankingsService` class into smaller, more focused modules or classes:
        *   `NflDataService`: Responsible for fetching NFL historical data.
        *   `PromptBuilder`: Responsible for constructing the prompt to be sent to the AI model.
        *   `AIResponseParser`: Responsible for parsing the response from the AI model.
        *   `RankingGenerator`: The main service that orchestrates the other modules to generate the AI rankings.

2.  **Improve Type Safety:**
    *   **Eliminate `any` and `unknown`:** Replace all instances of `any` and `unknown` with specific, well-defined types.
    *   **Define Data Structures:** Create clear and specific `interface` or `type` definitions for all data structures, including the AI's response format.

3.  **Simplify Methods:**
    *   **Decompose Long Methods:** Break down long methods into smaller, single-purpose functions. This will improve readability and make the code easier to test.
    *   **Use Pure Functions:** Where possible, use pure functions that do not have side effects. This will make the code more predictable and easier to reason about.

4.  **Add Unit Tests:**
    *   **Test Each Module:** Create unit tests for each of the new modules (`NflDataService`, `PromptBuilder`, `AIResponseParser`, etc.) to ensure they function correctly in isolation.
    *   **Mock Dependencies:** Use a mocking library (like Jest's built-in mocking capabilities) to mock dependencies between modules.

5.  **Improve Readability:**
    *   **Add Comments:** Add comments to explain complex or non-obvious logic.
    *   **Use Descriptive Names:** Use clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.

By following these recommendations, we can improve the code quality, fix the build, and make the `ai-rankings-service` more robust and maintainable.
