## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (User Decision Point)

1. **Option A: Complete Sprint 3 Phase 2**
   - Duration: ~27 hours remaining
   - Focus: Performance optimization, code splitting, skeleton screens
   - Benefits: Full mobile optimization, production-ready performance
   - Sprint 3 completion: 100%

2. **Option B: Move to Sprint 4 (Rookie Draft)**
   - Duration: ~56 hours (2 weeks)
   - Rationale: Phase 1 mobile fixes are production-ready, Phase 2 can be incremental
   - Benefits: Start delivering dynasty features sooner
   - Sprint 3 completion: 65% (Phase 1 done, Phase 2 deferred)

3. **Option C: Hybrid Approach**
   - Complete critical Phase 2 tasks only (TASK-054, TASK-056: 7 hours)
   - Defer polish tasks (TASK-057-060: 20 hours)
   - Move to Sprint 4 after performance validation
   - Sprint 3 completion: 83%

### Recommended Path

**Option C: Hybrid Approach**

**Rationale:**
- Phase 1 fixes are production-ready and user-facing
- TASK-054 (code splitting) and TASK-056 (performance audit) are critical for production quality
- Polish tasks can be completed incrementally during Sprint 4
- Balances mobile optimization with feature velocity

**Timeline:**
- TASK-054 (Code Splitting): 4 hours
- TASK-056 (Performance Audit): 3 hours
- **Total:** 7 hours (~1 day)
- Then: Proceed to Sprint 4 (Rookie Draft & Player Development)

## Technical Debt Register

### Deferred (Optional Tasks)

These tasks were identified in Phase 2 but can be completed later without blocking production:

1. **TASK-057: API Response Optimization (2h)**
   - Impact: Medium
   - Sprint 2 caching already addresses performance
   - Can be optimized incrementally

2. **TASK-058: Touch Target Audit (Remaining Pages) (3h)**
   - Impact: Low
   - Dashboard + Rankings cover 80% of user interactions
   - Other pages already mobile-ready

3. **TASK-059: Reusable Mobile Table Component (4h)**
   - Impact: Medium
   - Pattern established in Rankings page
   - Can extract to component during Sprint 7 (Component Refactoring)

4. **TASK-060: Loading States & Skeleton Screens (3h)**
   - Impact: Low-Medium
   - Nice-to-have UX polish
   - Can be added incrementally per page

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well ‚úÖ

1. **Agent Validation Process**
   - Using `pr-review-toolkit` agents before pushing caught 3 critical issues
   - Code-reviewer agent provided architectural feedback
   - Prevented production bugs

2. **Mobile-First Pattern Established**
   - Card view + table view pattern proven effective
   - Responsive breakpoints standardized (375px ‚Üí 640px ‚Üí 768px)
   - Reusable across future pages

3. **Atomic Commits**
   - Each task = 1 commit with detailed message
   - Co-authoring attribution to Claude maintained
   - Easy rollback if needed

4. **Documentation Quality**
   - Comprehensive audit document guides future work
   - Process documentation enables parallelization
   - Status tracking provides clear progress visibility

### What Could Be Improved üîÑ

1. **Initial Estimates**
   - Dashboard fixes took 5h + 2h (agent fixes) = 7h vs 5h estimated
   - Rankings fixes took 4h + 1h (stats grid) = 5h vs 4h estimated
   - Future: Add 20% buffer for agent review cycles

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Manual testing in Chrome DevTools sufficient for Phase 1
   - Phase 2 requires automated Lighthouse CI integration
   - Consider visual regression testing for future sprints

3. **Parallel Work**
   - Agent-based parallel audits could have saved time
   - Single-agent sequential work was reliable but slower
   - Future: Leverage parallelization for independent tasks
