# TASK-057 Font Investigation Results

**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Investigation:** Font Preloading to Reduce CLS
**Status:** ❌ Failed - No Improvement
**Duration:** ~1 hour

---

## Executive Summary

Investigated font loading as a potential root cause for the remaining 0.15 CLS on the Rankings page. Implemented font preloading optimization but testing showed **NO improvement**. CLS remains at 0.15, confirming that font loading (FOUT) is **NOT** the root cause of the layout shift.

**Key Results:**
- ❌ **CLS Unchanged:** 0.15 → 0.15 (0% improvement)
- ⚠️ **Layout Shift Timing Changed:** 4.5s → 6.4s (shift moved LATER)
- ✅ **No Regressions:** LCP and other metrics unaffected
- ✅ **Zero Bundle Impact:** Preload links are HTML hints only

---

## Hypothesis

**Original Theory:** The 4.5s layout shift (score: 0.1547) was caused by web font loading triggering FOUT (Flash of Unstyled Text), causing text to reflow when Geist fonts loaded.

**Evidence Supporting Hypothesis:**
1. Two Geist font files loading from Next.js static assets
2. Fonts: `028c0d39d2e8f589-s.p.woff2` (Geist Sans) and `5b01f339abf2f1a5.p.woff2` (Geist Mono)
3. Font loading timing aligned with layout shift window
4. No other obvious root causes identified by Chrome DevTools

---

## Implementation

### Changes Made

**File:** `app/layout.tsx`

Added font preload links in the `<head>` section:

```typescript
<head>
  {/* Preload critical fonts to prevent FOUT/layout shifts */}
  <link
    rel="preload"
    href="/_next/static/media/028c0d39d2e8f589-s.p.woff2"
    as="font"
    type="font/woff2"
    crossOrigin="anonymous"
  />
  <link
    rel="preload"
    href="/_next/static/media/5b01f339abf2f1a5.p.woff2"
    as="font"
    type="font/woff2"
    crossOrigin="anonymous"
  />
  <style>{`
html {
  font-family: ${GeistSans.style.fontFamily};
  --font-geist-sans: ${GeistSans.variable};
  --font-geist-mono: ${GeistMono.variable};
}
  `}</style>
</head>
```

**Deployment:**
- Commit: 05dbb1e
- Built successfully with no errors
- No bundle size increase (preload is HTML hint only)
- Deployed to production: https://dynastyff.vercel.app/rankings

## Analysis

### What Happened

1. **CLS Did Not Improve:** Still 0.15, same as before font preloading
2. **Layout Shift Moved Later:** From 4.5s to 6.4s (1.9s delay)
3. **Same Shift Score:** 0.1547 (identical to before)
4. **No Root Cause Identified:** Chrome DevTools still reports "No potential root causes identified"

### Why Font Preloading Didn't Help

**Possible Explanations:**

1. **Fonts Were Already Optimized**
   - Next.js 15 automatically optimizes fonts
   - Geist fonts may already be efficiently loaded
   - Preload hints redundant with Next.js font system

2. **Font Loading Not the Root Cause**
   - Layout shift may be caused by something else entirely
   - Font reflow might not be significant enough to register as CLS
   - The 0.1547 shift is triggered by different content

3. **Shift Timing Change Suggests Different Cause**
   - Shift moved from 4.5s to 6.4s
   - This suggests the shift is NOT tied to font loading timing
   - If fonts caused it, preloading should eliminate it, not delay it

### Conclusion

**Font loading (FOUT) is NOT the root cause of the 0.15 CLS.** The hypothesis was incorrect.

---

## Remaining Questions

1. **What causes the 6.4s layout shift?**
   - Not fonts
   - Not identified by DevTools
   - Still unknown

2. **Why did the shift move later (4.5s → 6.4s)?**
   - Font preloading may have changed render timing
   - Shift may be dependent on some other async operation
   - Cause unclear

3. **Is 0.15 CLS acceptable?**
   - 37.5% improvement from original 0.24
   - Still above "Good" threshold (<0.1)
   - May be acceptable given diminishing returns

## Alternative Investigation Approaches

Since font loading was disproven, here are other potential root causes to investigate:

### 1. React Hydration Mismatch
**Theory:** Client-side hydration differs from SSR, causing layout shift

**Investigation Steps:**
- Compare SSR HTML vs hydrated DOM
- Check for conditional rendering based on `window` or client-only state
- Look for `useEffect` that modifies layout

**Estimated Time:** 2 hours

### 2. Skeleton Removal Timing
**Theory:** Skeleton removed before content fully stabilizes

**Investigation Steps:**
- Add 200-500ms delay before removing skeleton
- Ensure all dynamic content renders before skeleton removal
- Test with extended skeleton display

**Estimated Time:** 1 hour

### 3. Dynamic Content Rendering
**Theory:** Badges, tier colors, or injury status render late

**Investigation Steps:**
- Identify which elements render after skeleton
- Ensure all dynamic content pre-rendered or reserved space
- Check for async data affecting layout

**Estimated Time:** 1.5 hours

### 4. CSS Animations/Transitions
**Theory:** CSS transitions or animations trigger layout changes

**Investigation Steps:**
- Review all CSS transitions on ranking cards
- Check for delayed animations
- Disable animations and re-test

**Estimated Time:** 1 hour

### 5. Virtual Scrolling (TASK-058)
**Theory:** Large DOM (1,790 elements) causes slow layout calculations

**Approach:** Implement react-window to reduce rendered DOM

**Benefits:**
- May indirectly improve CLS by improving render performance
- Addresses known performance issue (DOM size)
- Higher ROI than continued CLS micro-optimization

**Estimated Time:** 6 hours

---

## Recommendations

### Option A: Continue CLS Investigation
- Try next hypothesis (React hydration or skeleton timing)
- Estimated: 1-2 hours per approach
- Risk: Diminishing returns, may not reach <0.1 threshold

### Option B: Accept Current CLS (0.15)
- 37.5% improvement from baseline (0.24)
- Focus on higher-impact optimizations (virtual scrolling)
- Re-test CLS after TASK-058 (may improve indirectly)

### Option C: Proceed to TASK-058 (Virtual Scrolling)
- **Recommended approach**
- Addresses known DOM size issue (1,790 elements)
- May improve CLS as a side effect
- Higher certainty of success
- Greater overall performance impact

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Font Investigation
- **Time Spent:** 1 hour
- **Result:** No improvement
- **Learning:** Font loading is NOT the root cause
- **Value:** Eliminated one hypothesis

### Continuing CLS Investigation
- **Estimated Time:** 2-4 hours (multiple approaches)
- **Success Probability:** Low-Medium (no clear root cause)
- **Potential Gain:** 0.05 CLS reduction (0.15 → 0.10)
- **Risk:** High effort, uncertain outcome

### Virtual Scrolling (TASK-058)
- **Estimated Time:** 6 hours
- **Success Probability:** High (proven technique)
- **Potential Gain:**
  - 60-70% DOM size reduction (1,790 → ~500 elements)
  - Faster scroll performance
  - May improve CLS indirectly
  - Better overall UX
- **Risk:** Low (well-documented approach)

## Next Steps Decision Matrix

| Approach | Time | Success Prob | CLS Impact | Overall Impact | Recommendation |
|----------|------|--------------|------------|----------------|----------------|
| Hydration Investigation | 2h | Low | 0-0.05 | Low | ❌ Skip |
| Skeleton Timing | 1h | Medium | 0-0.05 | Low | ⚠️ Maybe |
| Dynamic Content | 1.5h | Low | 0-0.05 | Low | ❌ Skip |
| CSS Animations | 1h | Low | 0-0.05 | Low | ❌ Skip |
| Virtual Scrolling | 6h | High | 0-0.05+ | High | ✅ **Do This** |
| Accept 0.15 CLS | 0h | N/A | 0 | Medium | ✅ **Acceptable** |

---

## Conclusion

**Font preloading investigation was unsuccessful but valuable.** We've eliminated font loading as a root cause and learned that the 0.15 CLS is caused by something else.

**Recommendation:** Proceed to TASK-058 (Virtual Scrolling) instead of continuing CLS micro-optimization. Virtual scrolling has:
- Higher certainty of success
- Greater overall performance impact
- May improve CLS as a side benefit
- Better use of development time

**CLS Status:** 0.15 is **acceptable progress** (37.5% improvement from 0.24). Further optimization should be deferred until after higher-impact changes (virtual scrolling) are implemented.
