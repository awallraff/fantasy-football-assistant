# Architectural Review

This document outlines the findings of an architectural review of the fantasy-football-assistant project. It includes an analysis of the project structure, coding practices, and naming conventions, as well as recommendations for optimizations and refactoring.

## 1. Project Structure

The project follows a standard Next.js project structure, which is well-organized and easy to navigate. The separation of concerns into `components`, `contexts`, `hooks`, and `lib` directories is a good practice.

**Recommendation:**

*   No major changes are needed for the project structure at this time.

## 2. Coding Practices

The codebase is generally well-written and follows modern React best practices. The use of TypeScript, functional components, and hooks is consistent throughout the project.

**Recommendations:**

*   **State Management:** The `app/dashboard/page.tsx` component contains a significant amount of state management logic. To improve readability and maintainability, consider extracting this logic into one or more custom hooks. For more complex state, a lightweight state management library like Zustand or Jotai could be beneficial.
*   **Component Size:** Some components, such as `app/dashboard/page.tsx` and `components/enhanced-team-roster.tsx`, have grown quite large. Break these down into smaller, more focused components to improve reusability and make them easier to understand and test.
*   **Code Duplication:** The logic for handling the "No Leagues Connected" state is duplicated in `app/dashboard/page.tsx` and `app/trades/page.tsx`. Create a reusable component to display this message and handle the associated logic.
*   **API Error Handling:** The `lib/sleeper-api.ts` file has basic error handling. Enhance this by implementing a more robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff for failed API requests. This will make the application more resilient to network issues.

## 3. Naming Conventions

The project uses consistent naming conventions for files, components, and variables. Components are in PascalCase, hooks are in camelCase with a `use` prefix, and file names are in kebab-case. This is a good practice and should be continued.

**Recommendation:**

*   No changes are needed for the naming conventions.

## 4. Type Safety

While TypeScript is used throughout the project, there are opportunities to improve type safety.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Avoid `any`:** Replace any instances of the `any` type with more specific types. For example, in `lib/sleeper-api.ts`, the `getTradedPicks` function returns `Promise<unknown[]>`. Define a specific type for traded picks to improve type safety.
*   **Component Props:** The `components/enhanced-team-roster.tsx` component has a large number of props. Group related props into objects to create a cleaner and more organized component interface.

## 5. Styling

The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling, which is a good choice for utility-first CSS. However, there are some inline styles that could be extracted into CSS classes to improve consistency and maintainability.

**Recommendation:**

*   **Extract Inline Styles:** Identify and extract inline styles into reusable CSS classes in the `styles/globals.css` file or a dedicated stylesheet.

## Summary of Action Items

Based on this review, here is a summary of the recommended action items for the development team:

1.  **Refactor `app/dashboard/page.tsx`:** Extract state management logic into custom hooks.
2.  **Decompose Large Components:** Break down `app/dashboard/page.tsx` and `components/enhanced-team-roster.tsx` into smaller components.
3.  **Create a `NoLeaguesConnected` Component:** Create a reusable component to handle the "No Leagues Connected" state.
4.  **Improve API Error Handling:** Implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff in `lib/sleeper-api.ts`.
5.  **Enhance Type Safety:** Replace `any` types with specific types and group component props into objects.
6.  **Refactor Inline Styles:** Extract inline styles into reusable CSS classes.
